git init - idea for the movie/buying the set
your files are the actors
your code is the script
git status - is the PA (the person walking around telling everyone what the hell is going on)

git add of first file -When you first make they are auditioning to be on stage and when the Director (Whoever is making the code) says yes you can be in the film that is tracking the file.

git add of modifications - Once you're actors are cast the script begins getting written and when they finish rehearsing you add it to the stage

git commit -m - if the Director likes what's on the stage you record it and name the video.

git push - final approval for video

git pull request - bidding to hollywood

git diff - rewrites

git clone - bootlegger
